Many enterprise software developers still wonder why everyone is so concerned with client-side applications, HTML 5, Javascript, and front-end related “stuff.” Such skills are very notable on job postings nowadays, even for enterprise development based on Java, .NET, and Rails (which are server-side technologies). A developer might ask: Why does nobody seem to care anymore that I have a Java architect certification if I don’t know about RequireJS, AngularJS or whateverJS (front-end development tools)?
