On February 12th, 2015 I hosted the [Backbone.js Hackers](http://www.meetup.com/Backbone-js-Hackers/) meetup in SF at [Place](http://corporate.place.xyz/). 

Thanks [Avenue Code](http://avenuecode.com) for sponsoring the food and drinks and Chengyin Liu from Place for arranging the venue!

On this meetup we had 2 talks:

#### 1) Doron Segal - Vagrant + Node + Backbone + RequireJS showcase

This talk is a showcase about how these technologies play along in a effective way: Vagrant + Node + Backbone + RequireJS.

#### 2) Chengyin Liu - From Backbone to React: Our Experiences

Since June last year, Place (formerly Backplane) has used React to build a platform for online communities. Instead of taking 2 months off to rewrite our system, we incrementally migrated our stack from Backbone to React. We would like to share our experience to help Backbone developers to start with React.
