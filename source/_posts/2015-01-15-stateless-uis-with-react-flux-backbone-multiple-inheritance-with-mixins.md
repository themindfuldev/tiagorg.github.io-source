On January 15th, 2015 I hosted the [Backbone.js Hackers](www.meetup.com/Backbone-js-Hackers/) meetup in SF at [Brandcast](https://www.brandcast.com/). 

Thanks [Avenue Code](http://avenuecode.com) for sponsoring the food and drinks and Dan Lynch from Brandcast for arranging the venue!

On this meetup we had 2 talks:

#### 1) Hao Liu - Backbone View Multiple Inheritance Through Mixins

Backbone provides a convenient way to subclass your view through single inheritance. However, it does not prescribe a way to extend your view with properties from multiple superclasses, i.e. multiple inheritance. In this presentation we are going to discuss how to achieve multiple inheritance through view mixins, and demonstrate how it can be implemented as a framework.

#### 2) [Jordan Garcia](http://twitter.com/jordanjgarcia) - Writing Stateless UIs with React + Flux

Easier testability, quicker development and code that's easier to reason about are just some of the benefits of writing stateless UIs.  This session will deep dive into the core concepts of Flux Architecture and how it partners with ReactJS. Finally we will demonstrate how these concepts can be applied to your Backbone application to achieve a highly decoupled View layer.
