In March, 2015 I published an article on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com), about  effectively exercising collective ownership to avoid confrontation and technical debt.

#### Abstract
All in all, developers face regular frustration. This is pretty much because we are all artful individuals, so every single developer has his own tenets. Such tenets represent much more than what is taught in college - they actually constitute the developer's personality! They are your fingerprint, something that can identify you. When a second developer reads your code, he will start making assumptions about you.

When two developers’ personalities run into each other, there is generally confrontation. While this can be extremely educational and uplifting, it can also be disturbing and troublesome if both parties don't share a positive attitude. A key factor here is exercising what I call “thoughtful programming”.

This article will give a few suggestions about how to program in a more thoughtful way, by revisiting one of the XP (Extreme programming) rules: the concept of [collective ownership](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html).
