On March 18th, 2015 I hosted the [Backbone.js Hackers](http://www.meetup.com/Backbone-js-Hackers/) meetup in SF at [Remind](https://www.remind.com/). 

Thanks [Avenue Code](http://avenuecode.com) for sponsoring the food and drinks and Brenda Campbell from Remind for arranging the venue!

On this meetup we had 2 talks:

#### 1) Jerry Su - Upgrading your JavaScript with Webpack

Webpack is a flexible and extensible module bundler that can boost your productivity when building web applications. If you use or have heard of Browserify and RequireJS, then you know how these module systems improve code organization. webpack goes a step further and bundles not only JavaScript, but also CSS, images, fonts, and all other static resources with little effort. webpack also provides a development server that can improve your workflow by eliminating all or most of your build with an environment that is more fun to work with (linting in the browser, hot code replacement, and more) while minimizing differences between your production environment. I will focus on how you can start using webpack today on an existing codebase so that you can begin to take advantage of these many benefits. 

Check out the [list of commits](https://github.com/jerrysu/backbone-webpack-example/commits/master) showed in upgrading the TodoMVC/RequireJS app to use Webpack.

#### 2) Max Neunh√∂ffer - Extensible database APIs and their role in software architecture

These days, more and more software applications are designed using a micro services architecture, that is, as suites of independently deployable services, talking to each other with well-defined interfaces. This approach is helped by the fact that many NoSQL databases expose their API through HTTP, which makes it particularly easy to define the interfaces. 

In this talk I will explain the benefits of this approach to the 
software architecture and development process. I will keep the presentation practice oriented by showing concrete examples in ArangoDB and JavaScript, using Backbone.js
