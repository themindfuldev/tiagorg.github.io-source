On July, 2013 I published an article (in Portuguese) at Java Magazine #116, sobre o HTML 5 as an alternative for development exclusively based on the server-side. This technology introduces and standardizes many innovative features on the browser or mobile device, in a safe, portable and native way.

[Article What do I need to know about HTML 5? - DevMedia](http://www.devmedia.com.br/o-que-preciso-saber-sobre-html-5-revista-java-magazine-116/28078)

#### Summary
HTML 5 emerged as a movement to leverage many features designed to better explore the client-side in web applications, which can be beneficial in a few scenarios. This movement introduces certain client-side features such as offline work, persistence, multi-threading, low-level network communication, reproducing audio and video without plugins, geolocalization and form validation. All those features will be addressed on this article, as well a brief comment about the Dashorn project, which aims to make it possible to run JavaScript directly on the JVM.

#### When is the subject useful
This subject is useful for Java developers which want to learn how to bring the desktop experience to web applications, reducing the response and navigation time, working without depending on any plugin and having just one client-side codebase independent of device and platform.
