On Janeiro of 2014 I published an article (in Portuguese) at Java Magazine 123, about smart client-side applications using REST and Backbone.js, comparing with other web application types.

[Article Boosting applications with REST and Backbone.js - DevMedia](http://www.devmedia.com.br/turbinando-aplicacoes-com-rest-e-backbone-js/29692)

#### Summary
This article introduces smart client-side applications, comparing them with other web application styles such as Java web frameworks, highlighting the productive usage concepts such as REST, JSON and MVC on the client-side. Then, it presents Backbone.js and its main parts such as Models, Collections, Views and Routers, besides templating using Handlebars.js and communicating with a Play Framework back-end over REST and JSON.

#### When the subject it useful
This subject is useful for Java developers that need to bring the desktop experience to his web applications, reducing the response and navigation time as well properly organizing the JavaScript code in a structure based on MVC architectural pattern.
